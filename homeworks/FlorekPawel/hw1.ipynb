Applied the decryption formula: The Vigenère cipher decryption formula is `C(i) = P(i) + K(i)`, where `C(i)` is the encrypted character, `P(i)` is the plaintext character, and `K(i)` is the key character. In this case, I used a 5-letter key and repeated it to match the length of the ciphertext.\n",

So maybe \"Oizlvmz'a\" corresponds to a contraction. Let's assume it's something like \"don't\" or \"can't\". Let's see the length: Oizlvmz'a is 8 letters including the apostrophe. \"Can't\" is 5 letters, so maybe not. \"Don't\" is 5 letters. Hmm, not matching.\n",

For example, with a shift of 1, A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on. If the shift is 3, each letter is moved three places forward.

      "First, I should probably write down the encrypted text to have it in front of me. The message is: \"Vjg jwocp dtckp ku pgwtqrncuvke, yjkej ogcpu kv ecp ejcpig cpf cfcrv vjtqwijqwv nkhg kp tgurqpug vq gzrgtkgpegu.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Since it's in English, I can use frequency analysis or look for common words to guess the shift. I know that in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, etc. Maybe I can look for the most frequent letters in the ciphertext and see if they correspond to these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the ciphertext, I notice that the letter 'j' appears several times. Let me count: 'j' is in \"Vjg\", \"jwocp\", \"dtckp\", \"ku\", \"pgwtqrncuvke\", \"yjkej\", \"ogcpu\", \"kv\", \"ecp\", \"ejcpig\", \"cpf\", \"cfcrv\", \"vjtqwijqwv\", \"nkhg\", \"kp\", \"tgurqpug\", \"vq\", \"gzrgtkgpegu.\" Hmm, actually, 'j' is quite frequent. Maybe 'j' corresponds to a common letter like 'e' or 't'.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I assume that 'j' is 'e', which is the most common letter, then the shift would be calculated by how much 'j' is shifted to become 'e'. Let's see: 'j' is the 10th letter (a=1, b=2,..., j=10), and 'e' is the 5th. So the shift would be 10 - 5 = 5, but since in Caesar cipher, shifting can be forward or backward, I need to check if it's a shift of 5 forward or 5 backward. Wait, actually, in Caesar cipher, the shift is usually forward, so to get from 'e' to 'j', you shift forward by 5. But since we're decrypting, we need to shift backward by 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me test this shift. If I shift each letter back by 5, what happens? Let's take the first word: \"Vjg\". Shifting each letter back by 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "V -> V is 22, 22-5=17, which is Q\n",
      "j -> j is 10, 10-5=5, which is E\n",
      "g -> g is 7, 7-5=2, which is B\n",
      "\n",
      "So \"Vjg\" becomes \"QEB\". Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I should consider that shifting back by 5 is the same as shifting forward by 21 (since 26-5=21). Let me try that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe 'j' corresponds to 't', which is the 20th letter. So 'j' is 10, 't' is 20. The shift would be 20-10=10, so shifting back by 10. Let's try that with \"Vjg\":\n",
      "\n",
      "V shifted back by 10: V(22)-10=12, which is L\n",
      "j shifted back by 10: j(10)-10=0, but since there's no 0, we wrap around to 26, which is Z\n",
      "g shifted back by 10: g(7)-10= -3, which wraps around to 23, which is W\n",
      "\n",
      "So \"Vjg\" becomes \"LZW\". That doesn't seem right either. Maybe my assumption about 'j' being 'e' or 't' is wrong. Let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another common word in English is \"the\", so maybe I can look for a three-letter word in the ciphertext that could correspond to \"the\". Looking at the ciphertext, I see \"ku\" which is two letters, \"ecp\", \"cpf\", \"cfcrv\", etc. Wait, \"ecp\" could be \"the\" if shifted correctly. Let's check.\n",
      "\n",
      "If \"ecp\" is \"the\", then each letter is shifted by a certain number. Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "e -> t: e is 5, t is 20. So 5 + shift = 20 mod 26 → shift = 15\n",
      "c -> h: c is 3, h is 8. 3 + 15 = 18, which is 'r', not 'h'. So that doesn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe \"ecp\" is \"and\" or another common word. Let's try \"and\":\n",

      "e -> a: 5 - shift = 1 → shift = 4\n",
      "c -> n: 3 - shift = 14 → 3 -14= -11 → 15, which is 'o', not 'n'. Doesn't fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe \"ecp\" is \"you\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different common word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again, the ciphertext starts with \"Vjg jwocp dtckp ku pgwtqrncuvke,\". The word \"pgwtqrncuvke\" is quite long, maybe it's \"something\" or \"important\". Alternatively, perhaps the word \"vq\" at the end is \"to\" or \"so\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's try another approach. Let's look for the word \"ku\" which is two letters. In English, common two-letter words are \"to\", \"so\", \"no\", \"on\", etc. Let's assume \"ku\" is \"to\". So:\n",
      "\n",
      "k -> t: k is 11, t is 20. So shift is 20 -11=9\n",
      "u -> o: u is 21, o is 15. 21 - shift=15 → shift=6\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that's inconsistent. If k->t is shift 9, then u should be shifted by 9 as well. u(21)-9=12, which is 'l', not 'o'. So that doesn't work.\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I've got this encrypted sentence to decrypt using Caesar's method. Let me think about how to approach this. Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The challenge is to figure out the shift used.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that in Caesar's cipher, the most common shift is by 3 places, as that's the one supposedly used by Julius Caesar. But sometimes it could be a different number, so I shouldn't assume that right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the encrypted text: \"Wkh Plojudp hashulphqw vkrzhg wkdw shrsoh duh zloolqj wr rehb dxwkrulwb hyhq zkhq wkhlu dfwlrqv pdb kdup rwkhuv.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I notice that the first word is \"Wkh.\" If I shift each letter back by 3, W becomes T, K becomes H, and H becomes E. So \"Wkh\" would become \"The.\" That makes sense because \"The\" is a common starting word in English sentences. Let me test this shift on the next word: \"Plojudp.\" Shifting each letter back by 3: P→O, L→I, O→L, J→G, U→R, D→A, P→O. So \"Plojudp\" becomes \"Oiligra\"? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. P→O, L→I, O→L, J→G, U→R, D→A, P→O. So it's \"Oilg... wait, maybe I missed a letter. Let me count: P L O J U D P. That's 7 letters. Shifting each back by 3: O I L G R A O. So \"Oilgrao\"? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift isn't 3. Let me try a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way is to look for common words. The encrypted text has \"vkrzhg.\" If I shift that back by 3, V→S, K→H, R→O, Z→W, H→E, G→D. So \"vkrzhg\" becomes \"showed.\" That makes sense. So maybe the shift is indeed 3. Let me confirm with another word. \"shrsoh\" shifted back by 3: S→P, H→E, R→O, S→P, O→L, H→E. So \"peopole\"? Wait, that's not right. It should be \"people.\" Oh, I see, \"shrsoh\" shifted back by 3 is \"people.\" Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the shift is 3 places backward. Now, I can apply this shift to the entire sentence. Let me go through each word step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Wkh\" → T, H, E → \"The\"\n",
      "2. \"Plojudp\" → O, I, L, G, R, A, O → \"Oilgrao\"? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check each letter again:\n",

      "   - U → R\n",
      "   - D → A\n",
      "   - P → O\n",
      "   So \"Oilgrao.\" Hmm, that's not a word. Maybe I need to check if the shift is different. Alternatively, perhaps the word is \"Oligarchy\"? Let me see: O, L, I, G, A, R, C, H, Y. But the encrypted word is only 7 letters, so maybe it's \"Oligar\" something. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try shifting each letter back by 3 again carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should write down the alphabet and map each letter. The alphabet is A(1), B(2), ..., Z(26). Shifting back by 3, so each letter's position minus 3. If it goes below A, wrap around to the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for \"Plojudp\":\n",
      "- P is 16 → 16-3=13 → M? Wait, no, 16-3=13, which is M. Wait, but earlier I thought P→O. Wait, no, I think I confused the direction. If the cipher is shifting forward by 3, then to decrypt, we shift back by 3. So each letter in the ciphertext is 3 places ahead of the plaintext. So to get plaintext, subtract 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me clarify: If the encryption is done by shifting each letter forward by 3 (e.g., A→D), then decryption is shifting back by 3 (D→A). So in the ciphertext, each letter is 3 places ahead. So to decrypt, subtract 3.\n",

The same applies in reverse for decryption: each letter is shifted back by the key number.\n",

      "I notice that the message is in English, so after decryption, it should make sense in English. My first thought is to figure out the key used for encryption. Since Caesar's cipher only has 25 possible keys (shifts of 1 to 25), one approach is to try each possible shift and see which one results in a readable English sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But trying all 25 shifts manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can use frequency analysis or look for common patterns in English to guess the key. However, since the message isn't too long, perhaps it's quicker to try a few likely shifts.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the alphabet is cyclic, so shifting back by 3 from X (24) would be 24-3=21, which is U. But that doesn't seem right because I thought shifting X by 3 forward would be A, but actually, shifting X by 3 forward would be A (since X+3 = A). So shifting back by 3 from X would be U. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, in decryption, we're shifting back, so each letter is moved back by the key. So if the key is 3, then each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back by 3 to get the plaintext.\n",

      "So let's take the first letter: X. X is the 24th letter. 24 - 3 = 21, which is U. So the first letter would be U. But that doesn't make much sense because \"Uli\" isn't a common word. Maybe the key isn't 3.\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this encrypted message here, and I need to figure out what it says. The method used is Caesar's cipher, which I remember is a type of substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. My task is to decrypt it, which means I need to shift the letters back by the same number to get the original message.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall how Caesar's cipher works. From what I remember, each letter in the plaintext is shifted down or up the alphabet by a key number. For example, with a key of 3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on. If the shift goes past Z, it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet. The same applies in reverse for decryption: each letter is shifted back by the key number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the encrypted text: \"Ltvapvuz pumsblujl jvnupapcl wyvjlzzlz zbjo hz tltvyf huk kljpzpvu-thrpun—zayvun zaylzz jhu opukly svnpjhs aopurpun.\" My first thought is to figure out the key used for encryption. Since Caesar's cipher only uses a single shift, the key is consistent throughout the message. The challenge is determining what that key is.\n",
      "\n",
      "One common approach to cracking a Caesar cipher without knowing the key is frequency analysis. In English, certain letters like E, T, A, O, I, N are more common, while others like Z, Q, X are less frequent. By analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext, I might be able to guess the key. However, this method can be time-consuming and might not be very accurate, especially with shorter texts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another method is to look for common words or patterns. For example, the presence of short words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"that,\" etc., can give clues. In the ciphertext, I notice the word \"zbjo.\" If I assume that this might correspond to a common word like \"the,\" I can test that hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's try that. If \"zbjo\" is \"the,\" then each letter would have been shifted by a certain number. Let's map each letter:\n",

      "- z -> t\n",
      "- b -> h\n",
      "- j -> e\n",
      "- o -> ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because \"zbjo\" would need to map to \"thee\" or something, but the last letter is 'o.' Alternatively, maybe it's \"this\" or another short word. Let me check the shift from z to t. The position of z is 26, and t is 20. So, 26 - 20 = 6. So, a shift of 6 places backward would make z into t. Let's test this shift with the other letters in \"zbjo.\"\n",

      "Okay, so I've got this encrypted message here, and I need to figure out what it says. The method used is Caesar's cipher, which I remember is a type of substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. My task is to decrypt it, but I don't know the shift number yet. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should probably recall how Caesar's cipher works. From what I remember, each letter in the plaintext is shifted down or up the alphabet by a fixed number. For example, with a shift of 3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on. If the shift goes past Z, it wraps around to the beginning. So, to decrypt, I need to shift the letters back by the same number.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem is, I don't know the shift number. So, I need to figure that out. One common method to crack Caesar's cipher is frequency analysis, where you look at the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and compare it to the typical frequency in English. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, etc. So, if I can identify the most frequent letters in the ciphertext, I can make an educated guess about the shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the ciphertext: Pweizl Oizlvmz'a bpmwzg wn uctbqxtm qvbmttqomvkma acoomaba bpib bpmzm izm dizqwca bgxma wn qvbmttqomvkm, ackp ia tqvocqabqk, twoqkit-uibpmuibqkit, ivl qvbmzxmzawvit qvbmttqomvkm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I notice that the letter 'q' appears quite a few times. Let me count: q appears in qvbmttqomvkma, qvbmttqomvkm, tqvocqabqk, uibpmuibqkit, qvbmttqomvkm. That's a lot. So maybe 'q' corresponds to a common letter like 'e' or 't'. Let's assume 'q' is 'e'. If that's the case, then the shift would be the difference between 'q' and 'e' in the alphabet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me calculate that. 'q' is the 17th letter (a=1, b=2,... q=17), and 'e' is the 5th. So, the shift would be 17 - 5 = 12. But wait, in Caesar's cipher, shifting by 12 would mean that each letter is moved 12 places forward. But since we're decrypting, we need to shift back by 12. Alternatively, shifting forward by 12 is the same as shifting back by 12 because 26 - 12 = 14, but I think it's easier to just shift back by 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, actually, if the ciphertext was created by shifting each letter forward by 12, then to decrypt, we shift each letter back by 12. Alternatively, since shifting forward by 12 is the same as shifting backward by 14 (because 26-12=14), but I think it's simpler to just subtract 12.\n",
      "\n",

'k' becomes 'k'-12= -3 +26=23='w'. 'p' becomes 'p'-12= -2 +26=24='x'. So 'ackp' would decrypt to 'oqxw'. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe my assumption that 'q' is 'e' is wrong.\n",
